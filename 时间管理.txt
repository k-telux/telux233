The more one knows the value of time, the more he feels the pain of losing time.                  
Diligent man always feels time passes fast,the lazy man complains time runs slowly.               
Time is like a net. Where you scatter it, your harvest is there.                                  
Time is a loan, not even a creditworthy borrower.                                                 
Love can forget time, time can also forget love.                                                  
Meet you in a blooming time, in my best years, in my best posture.                                
No time to educate a son means no time to be a man.                                               
Because God holds time and eternity, these two things are beyond man's grasp.                     
Another year, another season, change is only time, unchanged is waiting.                          
Spending time thinking is the most time-saving thing.                                             
As long as you keep up with the pace of time, the God of luck will always follow you.             
It's not so easy to fall in love, it needs both sides to resist the harm of time.                 
It is better to have time to sigh at the past than to smile at the future.                        
Time has no present, eternity has no future and no past.                                          
The most difficult thing about love is not knowing when time will bring about any change.         
Give time, let bygones be bygones, let beginnings begin.                                          
Time has eroded my face, but can not change my heart.                                             
The more one knows the value of time, the more he feels the pain of losing time.                  
Time is a loan, not even a creditworthy borrower.                                                 
Love can forget time, time can also forget love.                                                  
Meet you in a blooming time, in my best years, in my best posture.
